# restaurant-css-framework
realise a window web page for a restaurant. The franchise is fictive, but the type of food (burger, pizza, asian, …​) is your choice.  The website must be responsive, at least for small and medium screens. It must at least have five accessible pages: welcome, menu, pictures, restaurants and contact.
